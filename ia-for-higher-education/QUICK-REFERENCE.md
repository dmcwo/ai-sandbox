## 📚 Key Research

**Nielsen Norman Group. (2019). The 3-click rule for navigation is false.**

**What it says:**
- ❌ User dropoff does NOT correlate with click count
- ❌ User satisfaction does NOT decrease with more clicks
- ✅ What matters: information scent, wayfinding, cognitive load
- ✅ Not all clicks are equal (page loads vs. instant)
- ✅ Task complexity varies (no universal limit works)

## 💬 How to Respond to "3-Click Rule"

**When stakeholders say:** "Everything must be within 3 clicks!"

**You say:** "Research by Nielsen Norman Group shows the 3-click rule isn't supported by data (Section 7.2). What actually matters is clear navigation with strong information scent—users can predict where to find content, labels are descriptive, and each step meaningfully narrows their search. We'll test with real users to ensure they can successfully complete tasks, which is more important than an arbitrary click limit."

## 🎯 What Still Matters

### Keep Doing:
- ✅ Avoid **unnecessarily deep hierarchies**
- ✅ Surface **frequently-accessed content** prominently  
- ✅ Make Top 4 Questions **easily answerable**
- ✅ Use **descriptive navigation labels**
- ✅ Provide **multiple paths** to content
- ✅ Design **clear wayfinding** (breadcrumbs, etc.)

### Stop Doing:
- ❌ Counting clicks as a success metric
- ❌ Using "3-click rule" as design constraint
- ❌ Assuming any absolute click limit is universal
