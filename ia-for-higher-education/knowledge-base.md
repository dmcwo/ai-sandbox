## 1. CORE NAVIGATION PATTERNS

### 1.1 Standard Primary Navigation Structures

**Pattern A: Topic-Based (Most Common - 73% of institutions)**
```
About | Academics | Admissions | Student Life | Research | [CTA]
```
- **Source:** NNG (2023), Higher Education Marketing (2025)
- **Use for:** Institutional sites, colleges/schools
- **Strength:** Matches user mental models
- **Weakness:** Can become too broad without subcategories

**Pattern B: "5 A's + 2 C's" (7-9 items optimal)**
```
Academics | Admissions | About | Athletics | Alumni | Campus/Community | Contact
```
- **Source:** Carnegie Higher Ed (2025)
- **Use for:** Universities, colleges
- **Strength:** Proven convention, familiar to users
- **Weakness:** May not fit all institution types

**Pattern C: Task-Based Service Navigation**
```
Services | How To | Forms & Documents | FAQs | Contact | Resources
```
- **Source:** Georgetown (2021)
- **Use for:** Administrative services (registrar, financial aid, IT)
- **Strength:** Matches user intent directly
- **Weakness:** Requires clear understanding of user tasks

**Pattern D: Departmental Navigation**
```
About | Programs | People | Research | Resources | Contact
```
- **Source:** HighEdWeb (2023)
- **Use for:** Academic departments, research centers
- **Strength:** Addresses key department questions
- **Weakness:** "Resources" can become catch-all

**Pattern E: Library Navigation (Multi-Audience)**
```
Find Resources | Services | About | Research Help | Hours & Locations
```
- **Source:** Adapted from academic library best practices
- **Use for:** Academic libraries
- **Strength:** Serves multiple user types
- **Weakness:** Complex because of diverse audiences

### 1.2 Navigation Item Limits

- **Primary nav:** 4-7 items ideal, 9 maximum (NNG, 2016)
- **Rationale:** Cognitive load, choice paralysis (Miller's Law: 7±2 items)
- **Source:** NNG (2016), Carnegie (2025)

### 1.3 The 3-Click Myth

**CRITICAL:** The "3-click rule" is debunked by research.
- **What matters:** Information scent (clear labels), cognitive load, logical pathways
- **NOT:** Arbitrary click count
- **Source:** NNG (2019) "The 3-Click Rule for Navigation Is False"
- **Recommendation:** Focus on clear wayfinding at each step, not total clicks

## 2. MANDATORY ANSWERABLE QUESTIONS

### 2.1 Institutional Sites (Universities/Colleges)

**Top 4 Questions** (must be answerable from homepage):
1. Does this university have my program?
2. Can I afford it? (tuition + financial aid)
3. What are my admission chances?
4. What is campus life/culture like?

**Source:** NNG (2023)  
**Implementation:** Clear paths in primary nav, homepage shortcuts

### 2.2 Departmental Sites

**Top 4 Questions:**
1. What programs/degrees offered?
2. Who are the faculty? (directory + expertise)
3. How do I declare major/get advising?
4. What can I do with this degree? (career outcomes)

**Source:** Adapted from NNG (2023)  
**Implementation:** Programs prominent, faculty searchable, clear advising path

### 2.3 Service Provider Sites

**Top 4 Questions:**
1. What services offered? (eligibility?)
2. Where/when? (location, hours)
3. How to access? (process, appointment vs. walk-in)
4. Who to contact for my specific need?

**Source:** Georgetown (2021), Carnegie (2025)  
**Implementation:** Service descriptions, location info, contact specialists

## 3. ORGANIZATIONAL SCHEMES

### 3.1 Hierarchy of Effectiveness

**1. Topic-Based** (BEST for most sites)
- Organize by subject/functional area
- Examples: Academics, Admissions, Research
- **Do:** Match user mental models
- **Don't:** Mirror org chart

**2. Task-Based** (BEST for services)
- Organize by user goals
- Examples: Apply, Register, Get Help
- **Do:** Focus on verbs/actions
- **Don't:** Assume users know your process

**3. Hybrid** (Common for large sites)
- Topic-based primary + task-based secondary
- Examples: Academics (topic) > Find Your Major (task)
- **Do:** Combine strengths of both
- **Don't:** Make inconsistent

**4. Audience-Based** (USE SPARINGLY)
- Organize by user type
- Examples: Students, Faculty, Staff
- **Do:** Use for utility nav only
- **Don't:** Use as primary navigation
- **Warning:** Content duplication, maintenance burden
- **Source:** NNG (2023), Carnegie (2025)

**5. Alphabetical** (ONLY for long lists)
- A-Z organization
- Examples: Department directory, course catalog
- **Do:** Use for 20+ similar items
- **Don't:** Use for primary navigation

**Source:** NNG (2023), Rosenfeld et al. (2015)

## 4. NAVIGATION DEPTH & BREADTH

### 4.1 Recommended Structure

**Small sites (<50 pages):**
- 2 levels maximum
- Broad and shallow
- Example: 5 top-level items, 6-8 items each

**Medium sites (50-200 pages):**
- 2-3 levels
- Balanced breadth/depth
- Example: 6 top-level, 5-10 second-level, selective third-level

**Large sites (200-1000 pages):**
- 3 levels (occasionally 4)
- Progressive disclosure
- Example: 7 top-level, 6-12 second-level, organized third-level

**Very large sites (1000+ pages):**
- 3-4 levels maximum
- Faceted search/filters
- Cross-linking critical
- Example: Libraries, institutional sites

**Source:** NNG (2016), Carnegie (2025)

### 4.2 Content Distribution

**Avoid:**
- One section with 50 items, another with 3
- Deep nesting (4+ levels) without justification
- Single-child categories (one parent -> one child)

**Prefer:**
- Balanced distribution
- 5-12 items per level
- Multiple paths to important content

### 5.2 Acronym Handling

**First Reference Rule:**
- First appearance: Full term (acronym)
- Example: "Financial Aid and Scholarship Services (FASS)"
- Subsequent: Can use acronym

**Navigation Strategy:**
- Primary nav: NO acronyms
- Page titles: Full term + acronym
- Body text: Follow first reference rule

**Exception:** Universally known acronyms (STEM, GPA, SAT, MBA)

**Source:** AP Stylebook, NNG (2023)

### 5.3 Common Higher Ed Navigation Terms (Usage %)

| Term | Usage | Source |
|------|-------|--------|
| Academics | 73% | eduStyle (2013) |
| Admissions | 68% | eduStyle (2013) |
| About | 60%+ | Common convention |
| Student Life | 55%+ | Common convention |
| Research | 40%+ | Research institutions |

### 11.1 User-Centered Justification
- "Matches user mental model" (card sorting evidence)
- "Addresses Top 4 Questions" (NNG research)
- "Task-based organization" (user intent)
- "Plain language labels" (accessibility + findability)

### 11.2 Research-Backed Justification
- "Nielsen Norman Group recommends..."
- "73% of higher ed sites use this pattern because..."
- "Tree testing shows users successfully navigate..."
- "WCAG 2.1 Level AA requires..."

### 11.3 Trade-Off Acknowledgment
- "While [Option A] provides X, it sacrifices Y..."
- "This approach balances [concern 1] with [concern 2]..."
- "For your audience/scale/context, the priority is..."

## 12. QUICK DECISION TREES

### 12.1 Primary Nav Organization

```
Is it an institutional site?
  YES -> Topic-based (Academics, Admissions, etc.)
  NO -> What type?
    Service -> Task-based
    Department -> Hybrid (Programs, People, Research)
    Library -> Resource-type + Services
```

### 12.2 How Many Nav Items?

```
Page count?
  <50 pages -> 4-5 items
  50-200 -> 5-7 items
  200-1000 -> 6-8 items
  1000+ -> 7-9 items (+ robust search)
```

### 12.3 Navigation Depth?

```
Page count?
  <50 -> 2 levels
  50-200 -> 2-3 levels
  200-1000 -> 3 levels
  1000+ -> 3-4 levels (with cross-linking)
```
