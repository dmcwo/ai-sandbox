# Information Architecture Recommendations for UC San Diego Library Core Website

## Recommendation 1: Task-First Service Hub Architecture

### Overview
Transform the current noun-based organizational structure into a verb-based, task-oriented navigation system that prioritizes user goals and service delivery. This approach positions the library as an active partner in user success rather than a passive repository of resources.

### Structural Approach
The primary navigation focuses on what users want to accomplish, with services prominently featured and contextualized within user workflows. The architecture groups related services under clear action-oriented categories that align with the diverse user mental models identified in your audience analysis.

### Detailed Explanation
This architecture prioritizes the verb-based approach you're seeking by leading with user intentions rather than library organizational structure. "Research & Discovery" acknowledges that finding information is the core library function while encompassing both targeted searching and serendipitous exploration. "Get Support" elevates the human expertise and service orientation that distinguishes academic libraries from generic search engines.

The "Use Our Spaces" category recognizes the physical library's continued importance while making space-related services easily discoverable. "Engage & Explore" creates a clear pathway for the community-building and cultural engagement aspects that transform libraries from resource repositories into intellectual hubs.

### Research-Based Rationale
Task-based navigation aligns with Kalbach's (2007) emphasis on organizing content around user goals rather than organizational convenience. This approach directly addresses the findability issues identified in your pain points by surfacing services within relevant task contexts. The Nielsen Norman Group's higher education research consistently shows that users prefer navigation labels that describe what they can accomplish rather than institutional departments (Nielsen & Budiu, 2013).

## Recommendation 2: Progressive Service Discovery with Contextual Mega Menus

### Overview
Implement a streamlined top-level navigation with rich mega menus that provide progressive disclosure of services, allowing users to discover relevant offerings without overwhelming initial choice architecture. This approach balances simplicity with comprehensiveness.

### Structural Approach
The primary navigation uses four broad categories that encompass all user needs, with mega menus revealing specific services and tools within context. Each mega menu section includes both direct service access and discovery elements that help users understand the full scope of library support.

### Detailed Explanation
This architecture front-loads "Services" to immediately signal the library's proactive support role. The mega menu for Services would display a grid layout showcasing different types of support with brief descriptions and visual icons, making previously "buried" services highly discoverable. Each service category includes both self-service options and human-mediated support, acknowledging varying user preferences and expertise levels.

The "Collections & Research" category maintains focus on resource discovery while positioning it as complementary to human services rather than primary. This subtle shift reinforces the library's role as more than a search interface.

### Research-Based Rationale
Mega menus, when properly designed, significantly improve navigation performance for complex sites by reducing cognitive load and providing contextual information (Nielsen Norman Group, 2009). This approach addresses the scalability requirements for your medium-sized site while ensuring services remain discoverable. The service-first ordering reflects Morville and Rosenfeld's (2015) user-centered organization schemes that prioritize audience needs over institutional structure.

## Recommendation 3: Adaptive Role-Based Entry Points with Cross-Pollination

### Overview
Create an adaptive homepage that allows users to self-identify their primary role while designing cross-connections that encourage discovery of services outside their immediate mental model. This approach acknowledges your diverse audience while promoting the serendipitous discovery central to your vision.

### Structural Approach
The homepage features prominent role-based entry points (similar to your audience categories) but with strategic cross-linking and "you might also be interested in" sections that expose users to the full spectrum of library services. The navigation structure remains consistent regardless of entry point but highlights relevant services.

### Detailed Explanation
The "Quick Access Hub" serves as immediate task-based navigation for users who know exactly what they need, while "For Your Goals" provides the role-based pathways that acknowledge different user contexts and expertise levels. Importantly, each section includes strategic cross-references to services in other categories, supporting your goal of revealing "adjacent possibilities."

This structure allows the ambitious vision of supporting overlapping user roles while maintaining navigational clarity. A student accessing "Learning & Coursework" would see relevant research services highlighted, while a faculty member in "Teaching & Instruction" would discover relevant community engagement opportunities.

### Research-Based Rationale
Role-based navigation reflects users' task contexts and mental models (Kalbach, 2007) while the cross-pollination approach addresses Spencer's (2009) findings that rigid categorization can limit discovery in academic environments. This architecture supports both directed wayfinding and exploratory behavior, essential for the transformative vision described in your project goals.
